## English version of the program of the 2nd Seminar on Artificial Intelligence applied to Sound and Music Composition

**Suguru Goto:** The Technique of Contemporary Music Composition with using Deep Learning

As a matter of fact, this composition is not an example of performing while using AI on the stage, but rather an example of using Deep Learning to compose and intends an instrumental performer to play it with a score. In order to do this, one may raise the following questions:  Can Deep Learning really influence on the progress of composition? For a compositional use, how should AI be used for the development of music? What kinds of new ideas can be explored to compose with Deep Learning? Rather, can it lead to new ideas? Can the algorithm that is regarded as a part of AI be used to truly surpass the traditional algorithmic composition?

**Jie Man:** Introduction of bach library in Max/MSP

Introduction of a library for the Max/Msp environment named bach, by which the two elements â€” computer-aided composition and real-time environment can be combined.  The usage and practical examples of the bach library will also be discussed.

**Shinae Kang:** A discussion of works created with the aid of AI and AI research trends for music.

Shinae Kang introduces artworks created with the aid of AI and AI research trends for music. Plus, she talks about the future possibilities of AI in the music area.
